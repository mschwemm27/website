<h2><a href=" http://climb.ucdavis.edu/"> Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology </a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>Year long program where I assisted in the mentoring of seven scholarship undergraduate students with backgrounds in mathematics and biology.  The students learned the concepts behind mathematical biology through a series of research modules which covered a variety biological fields.
<br>
<br>
<li> Aided the students in the formulation and pursuit of their own research project during the summer which involved modeling the effects of age structure and voluntary vaccination on outbreaks of measles epidemics.
<br>
<br>
<li> This is an amazing program which not only allowed me to gain experience teaching mathematics to students with very diverse backgrounds, but also exposed me to a wide variety of topics in mathematical biology.
<br>
<br>
<li> One of the research modules the students were involved in prior to the development of their own research project grew into a manuscript which was recently submitted for publication (<a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu/~mschwemm/Publications/Abstract_CLIMB/" >Constraints on the use of lifespan shortening Wolbachia to control dengue fever </a>)
